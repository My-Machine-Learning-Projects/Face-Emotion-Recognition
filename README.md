# Face-Emotion-Recognition
A project on emotion recognition using various databases

## Introduction
I tried using Machine Learning algorithms to classify human emotions into one of 7 categories: happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, surprise and neutral.

A comprehensive description of my efforts is available in the "Face Emotion Recognition Project.pdf" file.

## Uploaded Files
All the uploaded files belong to the "Second Try", as described in the pdf mentioned above.
The emotion categories in this try were: happy, angry, sad and neutral.

surf_bow.m is the code for extracting SURF+BoW features and training the categoryClassifier (SVM with Linear Kernel).
It achieved 100% accuracy on the training set (this can be verified from confMatrix.mat) and 83% accuracy on the validation set (this can be verified from confMatrix_val.mat).

The GUI.m file is a GUI for demonstrating the outcome of this project on test images, that can be obtained via webcam capture and upload. 

## Note
Files for the First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Try are available upon request.
