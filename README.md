# Face-Emotion-Recognition
A project on emotion recognition using various databases.

# Introduction
I tried using Machine Learning algorithms to classify human emotions into one of 7 categories: happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, surprise and neutral.

A comprehensive description of my efforts is available in the "Face Emotion Recognition Project.pdf" file.
